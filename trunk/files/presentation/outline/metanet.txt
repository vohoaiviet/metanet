METANET
=======

INTRO
=====
# the technical part of a project of the meta-don association: sociocultural studies in serbia called New[B]Order (http://www.meta-don.org/newborder/)
# concept of a spatial knowledge network
# web-based application for linking spatial and sematic data
# based on free- and open source software components

GOALS
=====
# flexiblity in usage: generic tool for scientific research projects
# administration: intuitive CMS interface for researchers
# METABLOG - artifacts input:
			+ text, sound, images, an mm data through CMS
			+ mobile devices for geo-tagged content input
# METAMAP - 2D map for customized geo-spatial representation of artifacts
# METASPACE - 3D semantic graph/subgraph associated with map artifacts
# semi-automatic approach for finding similarities/references between artifacts
# usability: advanced hardware and software interfaces to the user (e.g for exhibitions)
# statistics

CHALLENGES
==========
# customization of map for adequate content representation
# data consistency between METAMAP and METASPACE
# performance/usability aspects
# METASPACE HCI design and implementation

TECHNOLOGIES
============
# language: Java / JavaScript
# dependencies:
	- Semaspace (http://residence.aec.at/didi/FLweb/)
	- OpenStreetMap aka OSM (http://www.openstreetmap.org/)
