OPENSTREETMAP
=============
# OSM open source map solution for web clients (www.openstreetmap.org)
# like wikipedia for map
# no legal or technical restrictions on their use - full creativity
# other implementations do not allow highly customized overlays

CREATING THE MAP
================
# everyone can extend the map
# collecting GPS coordinates
# creating OSM data with OSM map editors: Java OSM (JOSM) - desktop app, Potlatch - flash, Merkaartor - for UNIX, WIN, MAC
# adding tags (node, linear, area) for OSM data do be rendered and upload
# generating rendered graphics on own computer by using tools:
	- Kosmos: lightweight OSM map rendering platform for WIN
	- Osmarender: rendering platform for generating SVG image for OSM data based on XSLT
	- Mapnik: opensource toolkit in C++ and Pyhton, all OS platforms
		+ default for OSM - Mapnik renders 256 x 256 px tiles served from the OSM tile server
		+ XML file holds rendering props like color, withs of lines, etc.
		+ rendered tiles are referenced by URLs through JS from web client
		+ raw OSM data can be downloaded for setting up an own tile server (e.g. planet.osm)
		+ uses PostgreSQL / PostGIS as spatial database (osm2pgsql converter for OSM->postgres)
		
# Slippy Map: OSM default web interface for browsing rendered OSM data

EMBEDDING
=========
# integration in web page like Google, Yahoo maps by using JS libs for customize the map and interface
	- OpenLayers: feature-rich, open source, most popular for OSM maps, BSD lic. (www.openlayers.org)
		+ dynamic map for the web page
		+ displays tiles and markers from any source
		+ separation between tools and data
		+ project of Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)
	- Mapstraction: JS lib wrapper for multiple implementations (e.g. OL, Google, etc.)
# several project on google code with topic OSM on android
# integration of OL in GWT through open source project GWT-OpenLayers (http://sourceforge.net/projects/gwt-openlayers/)
