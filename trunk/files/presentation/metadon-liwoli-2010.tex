\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{what are knowledge networks?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{network of people} with a high interest in learning, investigating, developing and improving the knowledge subject matter and share common work goals
		\item \textbf{enlarge the collective knowledge} of individuals (tacit knowledge)
		\item \textbf{community of practice (COP):} model for a learning process of self organized individuals connected within social communities sharing same interests (Jean Lave)
		\item activities of COP members usually bring \textbf{hidden and locked knowledge to light} that resides in our heads
		\item COP will enable members to more \textbf{quickly leverage the knowledge} that exists in a knowledge network

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{community of interest (COI):} knowledge network which is 'looser' than COP - larger in membership - can significantly \textbf{assist the knowledge worker} in trying to obtain answers to knowledge needs
	\item \textbf{knowledge representation and visual interfaces} (\htmladdnormallink{http://media.lbg.ac.at}{http://media.lbg.ac.at})
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{semantic networks} become readable if their structures are described through an ontology
		\item \textbf{ontologies} are abstract knowledge models for describing used concepts and their possible relationships
		\item interactive tools realize the generation of \textbf{smooth image of information} to take ambiguity and complexity into account
