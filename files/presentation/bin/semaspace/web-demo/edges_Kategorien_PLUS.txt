(1996/K395) Gleiches gilt für interaktive Installationen

Klotz	(AH)  interaktive  Medienkunst als unverdauliches mixtum compositum  ...   (DG) 30 Jahre Rückstand  in der Ausbildung ? 
Klotz	(AH) Auch der Begriff des geschlossenen Kunstwerks werde, so Klotz, durch den Aspekt der Interaktivität, von Grund auf in Frage gestellt
Klotz	(AH) Die implizierte Intentionalität, die sich im aktiven Eingreifen ausdrücke, verdränge die Form der interessenlosen Anschauung vollends, sie stehe ihr sogar konträr entgegen (Klotz)
Klotz	(AH) Für Klotz stellt sich die Frage, ob sich die interaktive  Medienkunst nicht Kategorien der darstellenden Kunst aneigne und deshalb zu ... einem unverdaulichen mixtum compositum werde
Klotz	(AH) Interaktive Medienkunst läßt sich nur schwer in gebräuchliche Kategorien der Kunstwissenschaft einordnen   Eine eigene Klassifizierung sollte  entwickelt werden (Heinrich Klotz)
Klotz	(HK) Der Computer als solcher ist keine integrative Kraft
Klotz	(HK) Die alten Künste werden niemals anachronistisch, sondern wir haben einfach nur ein breiteres Spektrum an medialen Vermittlungen
Klotz	(HK) Ich setze nicht auf die Medientechnologie im Sinne der Ablösung dessen, was gestern Kunst war
Klotz	(HK) Jedenfalls hat die Geschichte der Kunst in den letzten 180 Jahren bewiesen, daß das Spektrum der Medien erweitert wurde, ohne daß irgendein Medium obsolet wurde
Klotz	(HK) man sollte in Richtung der KI so weit vorpreschen, wie es nur irgendwie geht
Klotz	(HK) Oberflächliche Hoffnungsphilosophie
Klotz	(HK) Wir müssen aufpassen, den Werkzeugchharakter des Computers nicht zu verkennen
Klotz	(HK) Zum ZKM (Zentrum für Kunst und  Medientechnologie): Ich lege großen Wert  darauf, daß die traditionellen Künste auch  mit dabei sind, denn die Reibfläche für die Zukundt liegt darin, die alten Kunstgattungen auf die neuen prallen zu lassen. Man kann nicht allein auf die neuen Technologien  und die Medienästhetik setzen, weil sich durch die  Auseinandersetzung mit ihnen auch die alten  Gattungen verändern.

Leeker	(Martina Leeker) Die Theaterleute kritisieren  die technische Interaktivität und beschreiben  sie als Interpassivität. Sie etabliere einen  verkürzten Handlungsbegriff.
Leeker	(ML) Ästhetische Auswirkungen der Verbindung von Theater mit elektronisch-digitalen Medien
Leeker	(ML) Bei interaktiven Installationen gibt es keine Zuschauer mehr, sondern nur noch Agierende
Leeker	(ML) Das Performative als Schnittst. von Theater u. Medien avanciert zum Oberbegriff  für eine Kultur der ständigen Grenzüberschreitung u. Umgangs mit Unvorhersehbarem u. Nichtfestlegbarem 
Leeker	(ML) Der Betrachter als Autor in neuro-digitalen Rückkopplungen
Leeker	(ML) Die Immersion kann zur Entdifferenzierung von Mensch und Maschine führen
Leeker	(ML) Die Überschreitung liegt darin, daß in der  medialen Performance die Interaktion nicht mehr  als Handlungsparadigma eingesetzt wird, sondern  als performativer Vorgang.
Leeker	(ML) Diese Mischung aus technischer Medialität als Performanz und leiblicher Performance macht das Besondere der Verbindung von Theater und Medien aus
Leeker	(ML) Eine Technikgeschichte des Menschen entwerfen und performativ erproben  (ML) Institution für Medien-Performance-Forschung
Leeker	(ML) Immersion, als gänzliches Eintauchen in digitale Welten  (Das Interface darf aber nicht als Grenze zw. Mensch und Maschine markiert sein)
Leeker	(ML) Mit der Betonung des Performativen wird hier aber nicht eine neue, allgemeingültige Ordnung etabliert, sondern der Wandel selbst wird zum neuen kulturellen Ordnungsprinzip
Leeker	(ML) Mit Hilfe der elektronischen Medien und der Performativierung von Theater werden energetische,  über Wellen und Atmosphären wirkende Körper erzeugt
Leeker	(ML) Statt der Interaktion steht die Auseinandersetzung mit dem Ereignishaften

Mersch	(DM) Bei allem Erfolg, der technischen Medien zugerechnet  wird  die simulative Kraft von Digitalisierungen, die Erfindung von virtuellen, völlig unbekannten, sogar unerahnbaren Räumen, die Geschwindigkeit der Umsetzung und Bearbeitung, die außerordentliche Reisen ins Irreale zulassen  gilt es immer auch  ihre Barriere, ihre Grenze mitzudenken. Mehr noch: Erst von den Grenzen her wären die spezifischen Potenzen  und Leistungen von Medien auslotbar.  
Mersch	(DM) Computer: Ihr Formalismus arbeitet mit  Ziffernfolgen, nicht mit Zeichen, weshalb es  verfehlt wäre, den Computer als semiotsche Maschine zu bezeichnen ...
Mersch	(DM) Kein Medium vermag das andere ohne  Einbuße oder Gewaltanwendung zu überformen oder zu übersetzen ... (DG) Ein take over ist also auch aus dieser Sicht sinnlos
Mersch	(DM) Kunst ohne Medien wäre so sehr eine contradictio in adjecto wie eine Sprache ohne Sprache. Sie bedint sich der Medien und sucht darin, gleichsam als Überzeichnung der Grenze, als ihre paradoxe Figuration, den Entzug, die Kluft oder das chronische Ungenügen thematisch zu machen ...
Mersch	(DM) Mit der Technis. des Ästhetischen und ... mündet entspr. die Geschichte der Medien, in einer Geschichte der Mathematisierung
Mersch	(DM) Trennung zwischen aisthetischen und diskursiven Medien
Mersch	(DM) Unter aisthetischen Medien seien insbesondere solche gefaßt, die sich auf Wahrnehmung beziehen: Die Systeme der Optik und Akustik, die Künste, die  Bildgebungsverfahren aller Art, ... etc. Durchweg gründen sie im sinnlichen, während diskursive Medien sich auf Strukturen, Ordnungen, diskrete Einteilungen  und Zässuren beziehen ...
Mersch	Bei Medien handelt es sich vor allem um Ermöglichungsstrukturen (DM)
Mersch	Es gibt kein Medium des Sinns oder der Bedeutung (DM)
Mersch	Gestaltung von Präsenzen (DM)
Mersch	Medien als Ort einer VerMittlung (DM)
Mersch	Offenbar gilt, daß wir in der Rede von Medien oder Mitteln immer eine Relation oder eine Beziehung einschließen (DM) 
Mersch	Semiotisierung (AH) (DM) Der Zugang zum Bildlichen führt nicht über die Kardinalwege der Semiotik  oder Hermeneutik ...

Penny	(Simon Penny) Eine Reihe von Forschungdprojekten, die lose unter dem Begriff Bottom-Up-Robotertechnik ... treten nun gegen den Top-Down-Ansatz an (1996/K194)
Penny	(Simon Penny) Es soll nicht unerwähnt bleiben, daß das Top-Down-Paradigma mit seiner Machtzentralisation die logische Fortsetzung panoptischer Modelle ist. (1996/K194) 
Penny	(Simon Penny) Top-Down-Paradigma: Hinzu kommt, daß es traditionelle Dualismen wie Herr/Sklave, General/Soldat, Chef/ Arbeiter ... wiederholt und verstärkt (1996/K194)
Penny	(Simon Penny) Während der Roboter nun den berechneten  Weg zurücklegte, wurde die Umgebung erneut ausgemessen,  die Daten in den Plan eingezeichnet und dieser, wenn nötig, korrigiert.

Rokeby	David Rokeby describes interfaces as generators of experiences
Rokeby	Entwickler von Computerspielen als Meister der Illusion (D: Rokeby)
Rokeby	one of art´s tasks is to expose and deconstruct the rhetorics of interfaces (D. Rokeby)
Rokeby	Raumillusion (D. Rokeby)
Rokeby	the construction of experience. Inteface as content (David Rokeby)
Rokeby	(1988) Very Nervous System ! (D. Rokeby) Gestische Steuerung
Rokeby	(D. Rokeby) ... Technik der Interfaces den simultanen Schichten der leiblichen Kommunikation anpassen
Rokeby	(D. Rokeby) 1988 kam das Schlüsselwort  Interaktivität auf
Rokeby	(D. Rokeby) Auch unsere Benutzerinterfaces sind eine Art Glaubenssystem, da sie unsere Annahmen über das Wesen der Dinge und die Wirklichkeit in sich tragen und befestigen
Rokeby	(D. Rokeby) Das Zurückbleiben des Bewußtseins hinter dem  Körper: Programmierung die auf kleinste Bewegungen unter 1/10 sec reagiert ... Tatsächlich schien das System schon in dem Moment zu reagieren, indem ich mich entschloß, mich zu bewegen. ... An diesem Punkt werden das System und seine Reaktionen von uns in derselben Weise erfahren, in der wir unseren Körper erfahren. Das interaktive  System wird in unser propriozeptives System integriert.
Rokeby	(D. Rokeby) Die Entwickler von Computerspielen sind die zeitgenössischen Meister der Illusion
Rokeby	(D. Rokeby) Die wirkliche Erfahrung hat eine fundamentale Integrität, die die virtuelle Erfahrung nicht hat
Rokeby	(D. Rokeby) Ich fand heraus, daß das Gefühl des Benutzers, Macht ausüben zu können, wuchs, sobald ich die Zahl der Dimensionen der Interaktion verringerte. 
Rokeby	(D. Rokeby) Nur durch Desensibilisierung war es mir möglich, die Raumillusion, die das VR-System vermittelt, zu aktivieren ... In den realen Raum zurück- gekehrt, nahm das Innenohr seine Tätigkeit nicht gleich wieder auf: Eine Woge von Seekrankheit ....
Rokeby	(D. Rokeby) So ist die Explosion des Interesses an der Interaktivität vielleicht Teil einer Suche nach Asylen für sichere Interaktion: nach sauberen, sterilen, nicht Physischen Räumen, in denen wir unser natürliches menschliches Begehren, uns mit Dingen außerhalb unserer selbst einzulassen, befriedigen können
Rokeby	(David Rokeby) Wer interaktive Interfaces erstellt, übernimmt soziale Verantwortung
Rokeby	(ML) David Rokeby beschreibt Interfaces als Generatoren von Erfahrungen, da sie sich gleich einer Brille über die organischen Interfaces des biologischen Körpers legen
Rokeby	(ML) Eine Aufgabe der Kunst ist es, diese Rhetoriken der Interfaces zu entlarven und zu dekonstruieren  (David Rokeby)
Rokeby	Ästhetik der Schnittstelle (ML)  (David Rokeby)
Rokeby	Das Interface als Landschaft (D. Rokeby) Täler, in denen sich Benutzer zu sammeln pflegen (ausgetretene Pfade mit optimierten Operationen) 
Rokeby	David Rokeby (1993/P122)  (1997/K258) (2002/F043)
Rokeby	Die Erfahrungen des Seins entwerfen - wie formt ein Interface die Seinserfahrung? (David Rokeby)

Stocker	(1999/K414) (Stocker)  20 Jahre ars electronica wären natürlich ein Grund zur Archäologie der  künstlerischen Entwicklung ( .... Warum nicht  umgesetzt ?)
Stocker	(G. Stocker) Die Produkte dieser (Medien)Kunst verlagern sich vom Objekt zum Prozeß, von Information  und Präsentation zu Interaktion und Kommunikation, ... (1999/J68) (2001/K322)
Stocker	(G. Stocker) Wandel der (Medien)Kunst: ... wie es der japanische Forscher-Künstler Masaki Fujihata formuliert hat, from document to event.  (1999/J68) (2001/K322)
Stocker	... die äußerst fragwürdige Hoffnung, daß sich die in Technologieangelegenheiten verdienende Kunst bald selbst ihr Brot verdiene (Stocker)  (1996/J52)
Stocker	1.7.95: Bestellung des Medienkünstlers Gerfried Stocker zum Geschäfts- führer der AEC Betriebsgesellschaft (1996/J15)
Stocker	Augenfällig ist, daß die Vereinnahmung der Medienkunst durch die bildende Kunst nicht länger durchgeht (2001/K20) (Stocker) ... Dafür müssen die Kunsttheorien erst geschrieben werden. (2001/K20)  Was bringt diese Polarisierung ?(DG) 
Stocker	Berufsbezeichnung bzw. -berechtigung KünstlerIn interessiert nicht mehr, es ist so unnötig wie jene  Positionen, die dadurch verteidigt werden sollen (2001/K19) (Stocker)
Stocker	Die enorme Geschwindigkeit, mit der sich Medienkunst in den letzten zehn Jahren entwickelt und verbreitet hat, macht die Wiederaufnahme und Ausweitung dieser grundlegenden Diskurse über eine zeitgemäße Medien-Kunst-Theorie dringend notwendig (Stocker) (2003/K13) Leider hat die ARS über die Jahre wenig dazu beigetragen (DG) 
Stocker	Es ist keine Errungenschaft, traditionelle künstlerische Muster und Verhaltensschemata in die Medienkunst zu übertragen, die Herausforderung ist, neue zu erfinden. (G. Stocker) (1999/J68)
Stocker	Gegenwärtig folgt die Durchsetzung der Informationstechn. noch ziemlich einfallslos den Leitlinien des kl. Kapitalismus zu Ungunsten sozialstaatlicher Ideen (1996/J54) (Stocker) 
Stocker	Horizontal Radio: Telematisches Radio-Netzwerk-Projekt (1995/K354) (G. Stocker) (1999/J397)
Stocker	Medienkunst, wird nie auf die künstlerische Nutzung technischer Medien beschränkt sein. Sie ist  immer auch  ästhetische Recherche, kritische Analyse und gesellschaftliche  Kritik an unserem Wissenschaftlich-technisch indizierten Weltbild (Stocker) (2003/K13)
Stocker	Um tatsächlich zeitgenössisch zu sein, muß sich der Künstler als Knoten in einem technologisch determinierten gesellschaftlichen Umfeld begreifen  und damit eine auch höchst politische Verantwortung  übernehmen (Stocker) (1996/J53)
Stocker	Was unterscheidet das AEC als Museum der Zukunft von einem Werbecamp der Computer- und IT-Industrie ? (1996/P22) (Stocker)

Virilio	(Paul Virilio) (2002/K238) Geschwindigkeit des Terrors
Virilio	(PV) (1998) Nach der Beschleunigung der Geschichte der sgn. klassischen Kunst sind wir jetzt mit der  Beschleunigung der Realität der sgn. zeitgenössischen  und dem Auftauchen der aktuellen Kunst konfrontiert, die sich offenbar dem bevorstehenden Durchbruch einer  virtuellen Kunst im Zeitalter der Cyberkultur zu widersetzen trachtet. (Vergl. Take over)
Virilio	(PV) Dauererreichbarkeit  Haussklaventum
Virilio	(PV) Die Präsentation ist das Zur-Erscheinung-Bringen einer Sache   (PV) Neue Ära der Videoskopie: ... Die  Beleuchtung erfolgt nicht mehr elektrisch, sondern ist eine indirekte elektronische  Beleuchtung
Virilio	(PV) Nach Fernrohr und Mikroskop, haben wir heute die Videoinfografie. Sie stellt die dritte Stufe der Beleuchtung dar 
Virilio	(PV) Seit 1962 (Telestar   Satellit) ist die totale Überbelichtung des see it now eingetreten
Virilio	(Virilio) ... Ich weise die Vorstellung des Wortes als eines Modells zurück. Daher kommt mein Abrücken von der  Semantik, der Semiotik und Semiologie.
Virilio	(Virilio) Börsenkrach der Wall Street: Programm Trading  ereignet hat, deckt eine Beschleunigung der Transaktionen auf
Virilio	(Virilio) Es gibt keine Oberfläche mehr.  Das Interface ist die neue Form der Oberfläche. Dank der Elektronik, der Telesteuerung, der Teleperzeption begegnen sich die Videasten und die Architekten auf diesem Interface

Weibel	(AH) Das Wesen der elektronischen Kunst (Weibel):  ... Sie treibe die Entwicklung der elektronischen Kunst  von der objektorientierten zur kontext- und betrachterorientierten Phase voran und werde zu einem Motor des Wandels von der Moderne zur Postmoderne, daß heißt des Übergangs von geschlossenen zu  offenen  Systemen, von entscheidungsdefinierten und vollständigen  zu indefinierten und unvollständigen Systemen, von der Welt der Notwendigkeit zu einer Welt beobachtergesteuerter Variablen, von der Monoperspektive, vom Monopol zum Pluralismus, von Hegemonie zu  Pluralität, vom Text zum Kontext, von Lokalität zu Non-Lokalität, von Proximität zu Telematik, von Identität zu Differenz, von Totalität zu Partikularität, von Objektivität zu Beobachterrelativität, von Autonomie zu Kovarianz, von der Dikatatur der Subjektivität zur Eigenwelt der Apparate. (1992/K11)

Weibel	(AH) Von der Diktatur der Subjektivität zur Eigenwelt der Apparate (Weibel)
Weibel	(AH) Weibel betrachtet Systemen der Medienkunst als kybernetische Systeme, deren Ereignisse  rekursiv als Rückkopplung strukturiert sind
Weibel	(AH) Weibel charakterisiert diese Form der Kunst als sogenannte  postontologische Kunst, als eine  Kunst der Virtualität, der  Variabilität und der Viabilität
Weibel	(AH) Weibel nennt insgesamt 21 Kennzeichen oder Kriterien, die charakteristisch für jene neuen Kunst seien, wobei  Interaktivität als Reflex auf neue Eigenschaften der Medien wie Simultaneität, Ubiquität, Globalität, Katographie, freie Skalierbarkeit, Unendlichkeit, Immaterialität, Semiotisierung,  Beschleunigung, Temporalisierung, Dislokalisierung sowie Aufhebung der Identität und des Körpers erscheint. 
Weibel	(AH) Weibel zeigt, daß die Mittel, durch die Abbildungen realisiert werden, von der ästhetischen Theorie im Grunde ausgeklammert wurden
Weibel	(P. Weibel) statt Ding - Medium, statt Material - Immaterialität, statt Realität - Fiktion.  statt Sein und Realität nur Zeichen, Fiktion, Simulation.
Weibel	(P. Weibel) Statt Original - technische Reproduzierbarkeit,  Appropriation und Simulation, statt Autor - Kollektiv,  Maschine, Text, statt Wahrheit - Verdiktion und  Virtualität, ...
Weibel	(PW) Alle Technologie ist Teletechnologie
Weibel	(PW) Betrachten wir einflußreiche Ästhetiken der letzten zwei Jahrhunderte, dann fällt auf, daß sie auf einer Ontologie des Bildes aufgebaut sind, aufgebaut sind, auf einem statischen Seinsbegriff
Weibel	(PW) Der Ursprung der Technik liegt in dieser universalen Bedingung des Mangels begründet (1994/K17)
Weibel	(PW) Die neuen Bildtechnologien haben großen Einfluß auf den Bereich des  Wissenserwerbs, Wissensspeicherung, Wissensverteilung und Wissensvermittlung
Weibel	(PW) Die Transformation der Techno-Kunst kann als Transformation des ontolog. Tripels (Sein, Werk, Wahrheit) in das semiot. Tripel (Zeichen, Medium, Macht) beschrieben werden
Weibel	(PW) Die Werkzeugkultur ist in eine neue Phase getreten, in die Eigenwelt der Apparatewelt (1994/K24)
Weibel	(PW) Klassische Kunst und Medienkunst teilen sich einen gemeinsamen semantischen Raum
Weibel	(PW) Vom Ursprung der Techno-Kunst aus der industriellen Revolution
Weibel	(PW) Wir bewegen uns zu langsam,  daher haben wir das Auto; wir können nicht fliegen, daher bauen wir Flugzeuge; (1994/K17)
