\begin{itemize}
\item the technical part of a project of the\textbf{ meta-d.o.n association}: sociocultural studies in serbia called \textbf{New[B]Order} - \htmladdnormallink{http://www.meta-don.org/newborder/}{http://www.meta-don.org/newborder/}
\item concept of a spatial \textbf{knowledge network}
\item web-based application for linking \textbf{spatial and sematic data}
\item based on \textbf{free- and open source software components}
\end{itemize}

{
\frametitle{\textbf{goal}}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{flexiblity in usage:} generic tool for scientific research projects
\item \textbf{administration:} intuitive CMS interface for researchers
\item \textbf{METABLOG - artifacts input:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item text, sound, images, an mm data through CMS
    \item mobile devices for geo-tagged content input
  \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{METAMAP: 2D map for customized geo-spatial representation of artifacts}
\item \textbf{METASPACE: 3D semantic graph/subgraph associated with map artifacts}
\item algorithms for finding similarities/references between artifacts
\item \textbf{usability:} advanced hardware and software interfaces to the user (e.g for exhibitions)
\item \textbf{statistics}
