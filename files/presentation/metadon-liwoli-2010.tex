	\begin{itemize}
			\item java OSM (JOSM) - desktop app
			\item potlatch - flash
			\item merkaartor - for UNIX, WIN, MAC
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{adding tags} (node, linear, area) for OSM data do be rendered and upload
	\item \textbf{slippy map:} OSM default web interface for browsing rendered OSM data
\end{itemize}
}

\frame
{
\frametitle{\textbf{OSM rendering}}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{generating rendered graphics} on own computer by using tools:
	\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{kosmos:} lightweight OSM map rendering platform for WIN
			\item \textbf{osmarender:} rendering platform for generating SVG image for OSM data based on XSLT
			\item \textbf{mapnik:} opensource toolkit in C++ and python, all OS platforms
			\begin{itemize}
				\item default for OSM - mapnik renders 256 x 256 px tiles served from the OSM tile server
				\item XML file holds rendering props like color, withs of lines, etc.
				\item rendered tiles are referenced by URLs through JS from web client
				\item raw OSM data can be downloaded for setting up an own tile server (e.g. planet.osm)
				\item uses PostgreSQL / PostGIS as spatial database (osm2pgsql converter)
		\end{itemize}

{
\frametitle{\textbf{OSM embedding}}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item dynamic map for the web page
			\item displays tiles and markers from any source
			\item separation between tools and data
			\item project of Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Mapstraction:} JS lib wrapper for multiple implementations (e.g. OL, Google, etc.)
	\end{itemize}
	\item several project on google code with topic OSM on android
	\item integration of OL in GWT through open source project \textbf{GWT-OpenLayers} (\htmladdnormallink{http://sourceforge.net/projects/gwt-openlayers/}{http://sourceforge.net/projects/gwt-openlayers/})
